[Vitesse Prettier](https://github.com/johannschopplich/vitesse-prettier) is an opinionated [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) starter template based on [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) by [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu). It includes **file-based routing**, **components auto importing**, **markdown support**, **Prettier**, PWA and uses **WindiCSS** for UI.

This content is entirely written in Markdown. You can even use <logos-vue class="align-middle" /> Vue components inside it!
